# Smart-Traffic-Management-System
ðŸš¦ Smart Traffic Management System in C++ â€” log vehicles with plate, name, type, direction &amp; timestamp across multiple cities. Features blacklist detection, analytics dashboard, peak hour detection, and ASCII charts for real-time traffic insights.


Smart Traffic Management System ðŸš—ðŸš¦

A C++17 console-based application for recording and analyzing real-time traffic across multiple cities. This project demonstrates how smart city traffic monitoring can be simulated using data structures, timestamps, and visualization.


âœ¨ Features

1. Dynamic City Support â†’ Add and track any city without hardcoding.

â€¢ Vehicle Logging â†’ Records:

â€¢ Plate Number

â€¢ Vehicle Name

â€¢ Vehicle Type (Car, Bike, Truck, Bus)

â€¢ Direction (Incoming / Outgoing)

â€¢ Timestamp (hh:mm:ss)

2. Blacklist Detection â†’ Alerts on flagged vehicles.

3. Analytics Dashboard â†’

â€¢ City-wise leaderboard ranked by traffic

â€¢ Incoming vs Outgoing % breakdown

â€¢ Vehicle type distribution

â€¢ Peak hour detection ðŸš¦

â€¢ ASCII bar charts for traffic visualization


ðŸ›  Tech Stack

â€¢ Language: C++17

â€¢ Core Concepts: OOP, STL (vector, map, algorithm), Timestamps (ctime)

â€¢ Visualization: Console-based ASCII charts with colors


ðŸ“Š Example Insights

 === Analytics Summary (All Cities Leaderboard) ===
City          Entries   Incoming   Outgoing   In %    Out %    Vehicle Types
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shirpur       43        25         18         58.1%   41.9%    Cars:23 Bikes:12 Trucks:5 Buses:3

Peak Hour: 17:00 with 34 vehicles recorded ðŸš¦



ðŸŽ¯ Why This Project?
